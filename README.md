INSTAHACK

Instahack is a virtual social nook in the wide world of webs dedicated to coders. Coders can sign up, upload their profile photo and choose their preferred language to translate posts to. Don't worry, your password is encrypted using bcrypt.

On Instahack, you can browse peoples' profiles, start comment threads and comment on existing threads. If there's a post you prefer to read in your native tongue, you can hit the 'Translate button' which will immediately translate the post for you. Neat huh?!
